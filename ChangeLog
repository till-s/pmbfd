 20090625 (T.S.):
 - bfd.c: Fixed conditional compilation in elf2bfdsec():
   If 64-bit support is enabled then the 32-bit code
   must still be compiled (there is a run-time test for
   64/32-bit).

 20090625 (T.S.):
 - bfd.c, dmpehdr.c, dmprels.c, getehdr.c, pmbfd.h,
   pmelf.h, bfd-reloc-sparc.c (stub only): Added basic
   support for SPARC (no relocations yet).

 20090625 (T.S.):
 - Added ChangeLog
 - minor 64-bit fixes:
   o getehdr.c: added missing 'break;' to switch
       statement in pmelf_getehdr().
   o dmprels.c: Fixed wrong member name
       (p_p_s64 -> p_s64) in dmprels.c
